    "### ECF Power Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand ECF power flow analysis (or any other formulation), we first need to establish what equations the model uses to represent the physics of the electrical network and how those equations are then converted into a linear system in order to calculate the required information. The basic elements of the network include transmission lines, transformers, shunts, and simplified forms of generation, load, and a representation of 'slack' in the system, and power flow analysis must have a way to represent these elements. Each element is attached to one or two buses on the network, and enforces different constraints on the bus(es) it is connected to. For instance, a generator is described as a PV bus that supplies a fixed amount of real power and sets a voltage magnitude at the bus that it is attached to. Loads are represented as PQ buses that consume a fixed amount of real and reactive power. Finally, a slack bus is a reference point for the rest of the system that acts as a peusdo-infinite generator, attempting to set a fixed voltage magnitude and angle at its bus (and acts as a representation of power supply mismatch). \n",
    "\n",
    "In classic PQV formulation, we attempt to balance the real power ($P$) and reactive power ($Q$) at each bus in the system. Depending on the type of bus, we have a different set of 2 known and 2 unknown values: $P$, $Q$, $V$ (the voltage magnitude at the bus), and $\\theta$ (the voltage angle at the bus). These unknowns are what the PQV solves for with its linearized system, with each circuit element described using some combination of these 4 values in a set of equations, primarily summations of $P$ and $Q$ [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "With ECF power flow analysis, rather than attempting to balance $P$ and $Q$ directly, we instead model the electric grid as a circuit and utilize the same kirchhoff's current law (KCL) and kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) equations that are utilized in time-domain analysis for circuitry. Using equations that govern the power/voltage/current relationship for different bus types allows us to define the set of non-linear equations that we want to linearize and solve for using Newton-Raphson (NR). For PV and PQ nodes, a main equation is $P + jQ = (V_R + JV_I)(I_R - jI_I)$, or expressed for currents as $I_R + jI_I = \\frac{P - jQ}{V_R + jV_I}$ for use with KCL. Crucially, these equations include real and complex terms and are not directly differentiable. In order to make the system solvable, the circuit is divided into real and imaginary components where we solve for $V_R$ and $V_I$ as separate unknowns. While these split equations are still non-linear, they are at least differentiable and can be embedded into the linear system. The final split current equations are reformulated as:\n",
    "$$I_R = \\frac{PV_R + QV_I}{V_R^2 + V_I^2}$$\n",
    "$$I_I = \\frac{PV_I - QV_R}{V_R^2 + V_I^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the signs of the $P$ and $Q$ terms are inverted for PV buses that injecting current rather than consuming it. In addition, PV buses assume a fixed voltage magnitude rather than a set Q value. Since Q is a new unknown and we need an equation describing the voltage magnitude constraint, we need an extra equation before it is possible to solve the system of equations: $V_R^2 + V_I^2 = V_{Set}^2$. These equations are linearized using taylor expansion and are then solved for with NR [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that an iteration of NR can be expressed as $\\nabla f(x_k)x_{k+1} = -f(x) + \\nabla f(x_k)x_k$, the fully linearized equations for PQ bus are:\n",

    "### Implementation Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation closely follows the supplied structure of the original codebase. The primary simulator is contained in the PowerFlow class, with independent models for each element of the power system. The only worthwhile note is that matrix construction is centralized in the MatrixBuilder class, which handles both sparse and dense construction. Test cases can be executed using `run_solver.py`."

    "One of the fundamental difficulties when linearizing non-linear equations and utilizing techniques like Newton Raphson is getting the system to converge on the correct solution. Because some of the ECF power flow equations are non-linear, each step of NR is capable of producing a very large step in $y$ for even a small step of $x$. This large step can overshoot the correct solution, and cause the subsequent step to also produce a large change. This behavior can cause the system to diverge or oscillate without ever reaching convergence. Alternatively, a system may converge onto a non-physical solution if given a certain set of initial conditions. Using our understanding of the mathmatical properties, or by taking advantage of certain domain knowledge, we can apply heuristics that help the system converge on the proper solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage limiting is a relatively simple heuristic: we know that the real and imaginary voltage values should remain near a value of 1, and so we prevent our NR iteration from stepping the voltage too far outside this value. This can both be applied as a restriction on $\\Delta V$, and/or on the overall value of $V$. Importantly, this restriction only acts on values in the $V$ vector that exceed the threshold, rather than a uniform damping factor on the entire vector. In this case, we do both. This creates a localized damping effect that can possibly help NR converge more effectively [3]."

    "As stated in the description, the fundamental challange in designing a power flow solver is building a simulator that can robustly converge to the correct solution. This bears out in this implementation, with the larger test cases being unable to converge. It is also notable how many more iterations are required for this solution to converge over Matpower. Possible explanations are the solution as implemented is more unstable due to some incorrect stamping, or Matpower contains better heuristics that allow it to converge very quickly. Overall, while creating the correct derivations to begin with is a challenge, it is clear that heuristics are almost essential in order to solve large systems. While voltage limiting was a relatively easy addition, clearly the addition of heuristics do not guarantee convergence if the underlying models have other unaddressed instabilities."
